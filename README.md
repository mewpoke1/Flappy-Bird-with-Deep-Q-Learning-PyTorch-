# Flappy-Bird-with-Deep-Q-Learning-PyTorch-
An AI agent created by Claude Code that learns to play Flappy Bird using Deep Q Learning in PyTorch. In the first test, the AI achieved a max score of 23 pipes, surpassing my baseline of 15-20, without any assistance by episode 450. In the second test I added a human guided mode for teaching the AI, and the AI got blank score by episode blank.
